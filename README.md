#Checking the Coherence Value of Topics

[Palmetto](http://aksw.org/Projects/Palmetto.html) is a tool for measing the quality of topics. This short project uses [Palmetto-Py](https://github.com/earthquakesan/palmetto-py) by Ivan Ermilov and Michael Roeder to query the Palmetto service in order to check the coherence value of the input topic keys.

I used this method to compare different averages of the cv score with different numbers of (k) topics in order to see which topics tended to be most coherent. Each topic was on a new line in a text file.
